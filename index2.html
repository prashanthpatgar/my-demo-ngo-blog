            Doctors treating patients with NGO support
            While it is difficult to know the exact number of NGOs in India, an exercise by the Indian Government found that at least 31 lakh NGOs are operational in our highly populated land of unity in diversity. We have a plethora of volunteers working to the effect of social causes such as education, animal rights, disaster relief and so on. This goes to show that social service and giving back to the community, quite in-built values in our culture, are feathers in our cap. Here, we cover the success stories of 10 NGOs in India that are putting forth outstanding work in the healthcare sector to empower people.

        <h2>
            1. HelpAge India

        <h3>
            2. CRY: Child Rights and You
        </h3>
        <p>
            CRY(Child Rights and You) was started by Rippan Kapur in 1979 with six of his friends and fifty rupees at his mother’s dining table. They had a dream of witnessing a day when every single Indian child would enjoy his/her rights such as survival, protection and development. Rippan, a young airline purser, hated seeing children work as servants. As a part of his school’s social service club, he helped street children with reading and writing. His motto was ‘What I can do, I must do.’ Today, CRY is chosen among the top 100 non-profits making a difference in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            CRY works towards several causes for children, one of them being malnutrition. It introduced kitchen gardens in anganwadis in Chhattisgarh to provide fresh and healthy food to children. This not only came as a boon to the underprivileged children but also accelerated the anganwadi workers in the same direction. This noble initiative of CRY has helped to see a decrease in the number of malnourished children by about 9-10%.

        <h4>
            3. Lepra Society
        </h4>
        <p>
            As the name suggests, Lepra Society works to empower people affected with leprosy. It also fosters the healthcare of victims of lymphatic filariasis.
        </p>
        <P>
            During the British colonial rule back in 1925, the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association (BELRA) started to bring leprosy to the attention of Indian citizens. Established in 1988 at Hyderabad, Lepra Society brought into focus the Indian Government’s National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP). Today it operates across myriad states including Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi.
        </P>
        <p>
            Lepra Society had a systematic approach to dealing with the chronic disease. Its prime objective was to first identify its patients within an area via mass, contact and school surveys and then treats them with multi-drug therapy (MDT).
        </p>
        <p>
            Lepra Society’s success encouraged them to extend a helping hand to victims of other maladies as well. Today they also work towards helping patients of malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. They also help the Indian government in the National Anti-Malaria Programme (NAMP) and have extensive contribution to eye care and prevention of needless blindness.

        <h5>
            4. Smile Foundation
        </h5>
        <p>
            Inspired by the philosophy of Peter Senge, the founder of ‘Society for Organisational Learning’, a group of young corporate professionals founded Smile Foundation in 2002. They began working from scratch to bring about a difference in the lives of underprivileged families and communities. Since urban slum dwellers lack the education to be aware of diseases and healthcare, they do not approach hospitals for checkups out of risking a day’s wages. Smile has a two-fold approach to tackle this problem. They first bring quality healthcare services within easy access of the needy. The second step is to promote healthcare awareness and encourage the poor to seek help.
        </p>
        <P>
            Smile has a reach of 6 lakh children and families across 950 villages and slums of India. It has 200 projects on social causes like healthcare across 25 states of India.
